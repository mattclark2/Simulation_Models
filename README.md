# Project Title
*Land Shark Binomial Model*
# Description
This model solves the total profit achieved based on different uncertain parameters, including: the number of other bids and the amount of those other bids.
- This gives the Land Shark company a good idea of whether they will win the auction based on their bid amount and whether they should increase their bid amount.
# How to Run Program
In the *Formulas* tab, the **"Calculate Now"** feature can be utilized to run the simulation, which will present a different outcome each time.
# Files
The file containing the simulation model has been attached to the Land-Shark Branch.
# Versioning
This entire model was created using Microsoft Excel.
